## Creating _loop-challenge_ project

### Practice looping over the characters of string:

Write the function `vowelsAndConsonants`
The function must do the following:

1. First, print each vowel in on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o,
   and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in.

2. Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in on a new line in the same
   order as it appeared in.
