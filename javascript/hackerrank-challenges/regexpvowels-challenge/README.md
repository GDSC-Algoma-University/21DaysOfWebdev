Complete the function by returning a RegExp object, *re*, that matches any string *s*  
that begins and ends with the same vowel. Recall that the English vowels are *a, e, i, o, and u.*

#### Constraints:

- The length of string *s* is `>= 3`
- String *s* consists of lowercase letters only (i.e., [a-z])
