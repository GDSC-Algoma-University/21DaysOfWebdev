### Practice implementing inheritance and use JavaScript prototypes

- Add an area method to Rectangle's prototype.
- Create a Square class that satisfies the following:

  - It is a subclass of Rectangle.
  - It contains a constructor and no other methods.
  - It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area of a Square object.
