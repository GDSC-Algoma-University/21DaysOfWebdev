## Creating _throw-challenge_ project

### Practice using `trow` statement:

Complete the isPositive function. It has one integer parameter, `a`.  
If the value of `a` is positive, it must return the string *YES*.  
Otherwise, it must throw an Error according to the following rules:

- if `a` is `0`, throw an Error with *message = Zero Error*
- if `a` is *negative*, throw an Error with *message = Negative Error*

#### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 5`
- `-100 = a <= 100`

#### Sample input:

3  
-6  
0  
8

#### Sample output:

YES  
Negative Error
