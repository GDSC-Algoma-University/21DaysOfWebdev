## Creating _switch-challenge_ project

### Learning about `switch` statements:

Complete the getLetter(s) function. It has one parameter: a string, `s`,
consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z).
It must return A, B, C, or D depending on the following criteria:

- if the first character in string `s` is in the set
{ a, e, i, o, u }, then return A
- if the first character in string `s` is in the set
{ b, c, d, f, g }, then return B
- if the first character in string `s` is in the set
{ h, j, k, l, m }, then return C
- if the first character in string `s` is in the set
{ n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z }, then return D

#### Constraints:

- `0 <= s <= 100`, where |s| is the lentgh of `s`.
- String `s` contains lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z) only.
