## Creating _ifelse-challenge_ project

### Learning about `if-else` statements:

Complete the getGrade(score) function in the editor.
It has one parameter: an integer, _score_, denoting the number of points Julia
earned on an exam. It must return the letter corresponding
to her _grade_ according to the following rules:

```pseudocode
if 25 < score <= 30, then grade = A
if 20 < score <= 25, then grade = B
if 15 < score <= 20, then grade = C
if 10 < score <= 15, then grade = D
if 5 < score <= 10, then grade = E
if 0 < score <= 5, then grade = F
```

#### Constraints:

`0 <= score <= 30`

---

#### Sample input:

11

---

#### Sample output:

D
