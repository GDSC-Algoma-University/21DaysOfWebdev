## Creating _ifelse-challenge_ project

### Learning about `if-else` statements:

Complete the getGrade(score) function in the editor.
It has one parameter: an integer, _score_, denoting the number of points Julia
earned on an exam. It must return the letter corresponding to her _grade_
according to the following rules:

if 25 < _score_ <= 30, then _grade = A_
if 20 < _score_ <= 25, then _grade = B_
if 15 < _score_ <= 20, then _grade = C_
if 10 < _score_ <= 15, then _grade = D_
if 5 < _score_ <= 10, then _grade = E_
if 0 < _score_ <= 5, then _grade = F_

#### Constraints:

0 <= _score_ <= 30
