First compile the app in all apps/folders (`dashboard`, `hello-world`, `kiwi`) with commands:  
`npm run dev` - development build
`npm run build` - production build

Then start local servers in all apps/folders (`dashboard`, `hello-world`, `kiwi`) with the command:
`npm start` || `npm run start`

All commands look in the `package.json` in the root folders.
